# Hydra datasets configuration

The hydra configuration file for the creation of the datasets looks like this.

```yaml
--8<-- "configs/datasets/datasets.yaml"
```
## Metadatas

The metadatas contains the informations that are inherent to the semantic segmentation task we're working on :

* the number of classes,
* the original height of the images,
* the original width of the images.

## Raw datas

The `raw_datas` part contains the location of the directories of raw datas :

* the directory containing the raw, unmodified images,
* the directory containing the labels, ie the json files in the VGG format which contain the segemntation informations,
* the directory containning the raw masks, generated by the `SegmentationMasks` class, see next page.

## Raw datasets

The `raw_datasets` part contains the location of the directories of raw datasets :

* the directory containing the formatted images
* the directory containning the formatted masks, generated by the `SegmentationMasks` class, see next page.

## Prepared datasets

The `prepared_datasets` part contains the location of the csv's of the train, val, and test datasets.

## tf.Data API parameters

The `params` part contains the parameters needed to generate a tf.data pipeline.

## Segmentation classes

The `class_dict` contains the chosen integer representation of the classes of the semantic segmentation task.
